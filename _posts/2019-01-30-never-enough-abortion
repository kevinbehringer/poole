> In these divided times, it is important that we refrain from personal attacks and overheated rhetoric. So when I say that the Democratic Party is filled with bloodthirsty lunatics, understand that I do not intend it as an insult. It is just a description, and it is the most generous possible description I can muster at this point. In fact, I am doing them a big favor by calling them lunatics. But I believe in seeing the best in people.

How people can hold the murderous values that so many do when it comes to abortion is shocking, appalling, and worthy of our prayers for them to see the truth.
