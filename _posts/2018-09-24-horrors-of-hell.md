title: The Horrors of Hell
---
[Chris Gee, writing for The Master's Seminary](https://www.tms.edu/blog/horrors-and-habitat-of-hell/)

> In Dante’s classic work Inferno, the ancient Roman poet Virgil gives Dante a tour of Hell. When Dante first passes through the gate of Hell, he reads a chilling inscription: “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” Inferno, though a fictional work with many extrabiblical descriptions of Hell, captures a critical biblical truth in this inscription. For the sinner, there is a day when hope ends, the day he or she passes through the portal of Hell.

Sobering, but important read.
