> When the four-year-old daughter of the Lake City High School football coach Kyle Smith became unwell with an acute intestinal infection, members of the school community rallied together to pray for the young girl as she was treated in hospital. But the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF) immediately took issue with the religious activity. Due to the prayer taking place on the school’s football field, FFRF argued that it was fundamentally unconstitutional.

<em>"How dare you use a facility funded by taxpayers to pray to a God I don't believe exists for a young girl's health!"</em>

It must be exhausting to be this outraged all the time.
