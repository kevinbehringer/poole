[Former New Orleans Saint, Benjamin Watson](https://www.theblaze.com/news/benjamin-watson-men-prevent-abortion?fbclid=IwAR08Foa8OdvGrauIlXBMFTafwSZ1ThV_Smy0P4KzzQNbghphpVbUjBzs3eE&utm_campaign=glennbeck&utm_content=buffer7b3c9&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com)

> "Look, men are in a role of leadership in many areas," Watson began. "Men are protectors. We are providers."  
"Many women would not be seeking abortions if the men involved in their lives were doing what they were supposed to be doing," he concluded. "And that's a challenge to myself, that's a challenge to all men who are listening, that's a challenge to men everywhere to step up."

Exactly.
