title: Bill O'Reilly is "Angry With God"

[Bill O'Reilly](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/23/media/bill-oreilly-misconduct-allegations/index.html)

>"You know, am I mad at God? Yeah, I'm mad at him," O'Reilly said on the latest episode of his web series, 'No Spin News.' "I wish I had more protection. I wish this stuff didn't happen. I can't explain it to you. Yeah, I'm mad at him."

Here's the thing Bill. God is not responsible for your sin. God can and does use sin sinlessly, but He's not responsible for your sin. You can be mad all you want, but it doesn't change the facts. And, by declaring yourself "angry with God" over your sin, you're playing a dangerous game. I'd think twice.
